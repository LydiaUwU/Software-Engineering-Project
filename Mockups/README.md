# Hello World!

Author: Lydia MacBride

This directory contains my initial mockups for how the site will work. 
These are just dummy pages that that feature basic HTML5 and CSS3. For future versions
we plan on writing the UI in React.

## Sources

### Fonts
- Inter, Rasmus Andersson
- Karrik, Jean-Baptiste Morizot

## Design Priorities
- Clean readable design
- Intuitive layout
- Accessibility (will work on colour schemes soon)
- Make it not look like every other website in existence (I do not like bootstrap.js)
- Brutalist design
